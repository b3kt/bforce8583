<p><h2>Changes from version 2.11 to 2.12</h2>

<p> Changed tmake default behavior to output to default files - Makefile
in general, unless an output type defines the TMAKE_OUTEXT variable,  in which
case the filename is project_name.TMAKE_OUTEXT.

<p> Began to make tmake into a perl package called TM.
 
<p>  Changed 'make dist' option to remove generated build files, and 
not to compress the directory.
 
<p>  Updated the -lib option to allow build file generation for platform-compilers that do not match the platform os.
 
<p>  Removed 'qt' from being included in the default CONFIG options.
 
<p>  Unified all platforms so output type (make, nmake, KDevelop, Microsoft Visual Studio) is independant from the platform-compiler.
 
<p>  Added variables DEFINES_PREFIX, INCLUDE_PREFIX, OBJ_IMPL_OUT,
TARGET_EXT, TARGET_PREFIX, TMAKE_LIB_CMD, TMAKE_LINK_CMD, TMAKE_MAKE_HEADER,
TMAKE_REMOVE, VERSION, OUTTYPE, OUTBASE, OUTEXT, OUTFILE, TMAKE_OUTEXT.
 
<p>  Added functions ComputeConfigDependencies, ComputeUnixTargetVersions, 
ComputeWin32TargetVersions, which unifies most of the code used by 
templates.

<p><h2>Changes from version 1.8 to 2.11</h2>

<p>  Hosting of tmake added to sourceforge.net at 
http://tmake.sourceforge.net, with maintenance provided by Geoff Brimhall 
<brimhall@pobox.com>

<p>  Syntax processing errors with platform specific variables such as
"win32-g++:LIBS"

<p>  Addition of win32-msdev, and unix-kdev IDE project
file output

<p>  Updating of documentation to include IDE project files as well as
embedded platform Makefiles

<p><h2>Changes from version 1.6 to 1.8</h2>

<p>  Platform fixes for Tru64, Borland, Irix, HP-UX, AIX, UnixWare7
  and Reliant UNIX

<p>  Support for Intel C++

<p>  Initial support for Qt/Embedded on FreeBSD

<p><h2>Changes from version 1.5 to 1.6</h2>

<p>  Better support for threaded applications/libraries

<p>  Platform fixes for Solaris, Windows, IRIX, and others.

<p><h2>Changes from version 1.4 to 1.5</h2>

<p>  Support for threaded applications/libraries

<p>  Platform fixes, particularly on AIX

<p>  Support for the .ui files used by the Qt Designer

<p><h2>Changes from version 1.3 to 1.4</h2>

<p>  Support for the new Q_COMPONENT and other news in Qt 2.1

<p>  A huge number of platform fixes

<p>  Windows Registry support


<p><h2>Changes from version 1.2 to 1.3</h2>

<p>  Improved Qt 2.0 support.

<p>  INCLUDEPATH can have directories containing whitespace (use semicolon)
  as separator.

<p>  Many, many code fixes and doc improvements.


<p><h2>Changes from version 1.1 to 1.2</h2>

<p>  tmake is no longer restricted to C++ only.  You can now use both C++
  and C files in your project.  Thanks to Ulrich Ring for valuable feed-
  back and comments.

<p>  Added support for building DLL libraries under Windows.
  NOTE: Qt 1.42 and later now uses qtmain.lib in addition to qt.lib
  when your application uses the Qt DLL.  Add "DEFINES = QT_DLL" to
  your project file to use the Qt DLL.

<p>  New dist target added in the app and lib templates.
  Run "make dist" to pack all files in your project using tar/gzip or zip.
  Thanks to Kalle Dalheimer for this patch.

<p>  Fixed bad command line interpretation bug in tmake.exe and progen.exe.

<p>  Added support for Borland C++ builder 3.

<p>  Initial support for QNX/g++ and the IBM Visual Age compiler on Win32.
  Thanks to Igor Kovalenko and Joost Kraaijeveld.

<p>  Many fixes in tmake.conf for several Unix configurations.


<p><h2>Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1</h2>

<p>  Provides tmake.exe and progen.exe for Windows users without perl.

<p>  Added many new Unix templates.

<p>  Added subdirs.t templates.

<p>  Added system-dependent project settings
  (e.g. solaris-cc:TMAKE_CFLAGS = -pts)

<p>  Many bug fixes and improvements for existing templates.

<p>  Improved documentation.
